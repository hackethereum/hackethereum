# Hackethereum #
## Don't just get hacked, experience it. ##

Getting hacked is the latest trend in Ethereum ICOs and you don't want to miss out.

**Hackoin** is A new [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) token from the Hackethereum team backed by an Ethereum ICO which is guaranteed to be 100% hacked shortly after launch.

By holding **Hackoin** you can ensure that you will own a piece of cryptocoin history as you get the full experience of being hacked without the stress of unexpected losses, and without having to invest in every token out there. Your losses are 100% guaranteed from the start, so you have nothing to worry about.

The Hackethereum team will be working hard to build a guaranteed hackable token. We will be following the latest security best practises and even getting the rigorously code audited to ensure that there is no chance of **Hackoin** accidentally being unhackable.

As a conforming ERC20 token we expect Hackethereum to be tradeable on all the major exchanges and we are projecting a significant fall in value after the hack is announced.

### Stretch Goals ###

Regardless of the funds raised, Hackoin will launch and be hacked shortly after.

If we hit certain funding goals we will have the scope to take the project further.

- **10 eth** - If we raise just 10 eth we will commit to a hack autopsy blog post.
- **100 eth** - Following the hack We will post a series of vague and incomprehensible technical details to our blog and reddit to initially reassure holders before eventually staging a sincere apology and farewell.
- **300 eth** - While we can't guarantee the level of mainstream media furore we will ensure that the team create an interactive bubble of pandemonium and confusion on social media that will enhance the authenticity of the hacked experience for those involved.
- **500 eth** - We will be inviting holders of Hackoin to participate in specific online community outrage events that will be captured and archived for posterity.
- **1000 eth** - The Hackethereum team will coordinate white-hat hacking efforts in an attempt to partially gain control over some of the funds before the ICO account is completely drained. Blogs and tweets will be posted during the efforts to keep holders informed.
- **1500 eth** - Following the hack the Hackethereum team will launch a petition within the community requesting that the core Ethereum development team initiate a fork to recover the lost funds. The chances of a successful fork increase significantly the more we raise during the ICO, and becomes almost a certainty if any members of the core team can be convinced to invest.
- **5000 eth** - The Hackethereum team will create, deploy and run an Ethereum fork on which the Hackoin funds are recovered and available for withdrawal by Hackoin token holders.
- **Above 50000 eth** - We will use half of all funds raised in an attempt to <strike>bribe</strike> convince members of the core team and prominent community members into adopting our fork as the default in all official and unofficial Ethereum clients.
