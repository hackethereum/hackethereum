### Update 2017-08-08 ###  

Hackethereum is a blockchain based puzzle game where players work to solve a series of puzzles in order to hack the smart contract. **We have temporarily suspended the game due to poor planning on our part. We will relaunch soon with clearer instructions on participation. Check back here or follow us on twitter ([@hackethereum](https://twitter.com/hackethereum)) for updates.** 


<strike>
Getting hacked is the latest trend in Ethereum ICOs and you don't want to miss out.

**HacKoin** is a new [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) token from the **Hackethereum** team backed by an Ethereum ICO which is guaranteed to be 100% hacked shortly after launch.

Check out our [Hackethereum white paper](https://github.com/hackethereum/hackethereum/raw/master/Hackethereum%20White%20Paper.pdf).

By holding **HacKoin** you can ensure that you will own a piece of cryptocoin history as you get the full experience of being hacked without the stress of unexpected losses, and without having to invest in every token out there. Your losses are 100% guaranteed from the start, so you have nothing to worry about.

The Hackethereum team have been working hard to build a guaranteed hackable token. We have been following none of the latest security best practises and even been very careful not to get the code rigorously audited to ensure that there is absolutely no chance of **HacKoin** accidentally being unhackable.

### How to participate ###

1. Send Ether to our ICO contract at [0xD5413b99749D50c415df34Eb782c1a5db8Df02CE](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD5413b99749D50c415df34Eb782c1a5db8Df02CE)

    *The initial purchase price:*

        1 eth = 100hk
        0.01 eth  = 1hk

    The price **will rise** as the ICO deadline approaches. More details will be announced closer to the time.

    *Reward levels:*

    - **Less than 5hk** [0.05eth] - Non participating spectator only.
    - **5hk** [0.05eth] - Participant.
    - **Over 5hk, up to 50hk** [0.05eth to 0.5eth] - Gold participant.
    - **100hk** [1eth] - Platinum participant.
    
    More details on participation will be announced in the coming weeks. Participant activities will depend in the funding level reached.

2. Watch the **HacKoin** token to check your balance - [0xba67FdaE6FaDE46c075b01482D6157144533222C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xba67FdaE6FaDE46c075b01482D6157144533222C)

        Symbol: HK
        Decimals: 16

3. Follow our twitter account [@hackethereum](https://twitter.com/hackethereum) for important announcements.

### Stretch Goals ###

Regardless of the funds raised, **HacKoin** will launch and be hacked shortly after. All funds will be lost.

If we hit certain funding goals we will have the scope to take the project further.

- **10 eth** - If we raise just 10 eth we will commit to a hack autopsy blog post.
- **100 eth** - Following the hack we will post a series of vague and incomprehensible technical details to our blog and reddit to initially reassure holders before eventually staging a sincere apology and farewell.
- **300 eth** - While we can't guarantee the level of mainstream media furore we will ensure that the team create an interactive bubble of pandemonium and confusion on social media that will enhance the authenticity of the hacked experience for those involved.
- **500 eth** - We will be inviting holders of **HacKoin** to participate in specific online community outrage events that will be captured and archived for posterity.
- **1000 eth** - The Hackethereum team will coordinate white-hat hacking efforts in an attempt to partially gain control over some of the funds before the ICO account is completely drained. Blogs and tweets will be posted during the efforts to keep holders informed.
- **2000 eth** - Following the hack the Hackethereum team will launch a petition within the community requesting that the core Ethereum development team initiate a fork to recover the lost funds. The chances of a successful fork increase significantly the more we raise during the ICO, and becomes almost a certainty if any members of the core team can be convinced to participate.
- **5000 eth** - The Hackethereum team will create, deploy and run an Ethereum fork on which the **HacKoin** funds are recovered and available for withdrawal by **HacKoin** token holders.
- **Above 50000 eth** - We will use half of all funds raised in an attempt to <strike>bribe</strike> convince members of the core team and prominent community members into adopting our fork as the default in all official and unofficial Ethereum clients.

We have some other fun plans for Hackethereum that we will announce in due course.

### FAQs ###

**Is this an investment?**

 - No, it is not an investment. You will not get any of your money back. Your token does not confer any rights of any kind. 100% of the funds will be hacked.

**Is this a crowd fund raiser?**

 - No, we aren't raising funds, the ICO has already begun and will be hacked shortly after completion even if zero contributions are made. 

**What the hell is this then?**

 - It's an satirical performance art project for the crypto generation. Your Ethereum contribution is your ticket purchase. Your **HacKoins** are your ticket. Hold on to your ticket, kick back, and enjoy the show.

**Is everything written here true?**

 - No. Maybe. This is a performance project. Many things will be written 'in character' and will be 'true' within the context of the story. Other things will be entirely fictional.

**Can't I just watch the show without purchasing a ticket?**

 - You might think that you can just stand by a watch the drama roll on by without participating in the ICO, but if you do you'll be missing the greater point. To truly experience the hack you need to be invested in the outcome. You need the sickening feeling in the pit of you stomach when you wake up to find yourself staring bleary eyed at a tweet reporting the hack of your favourite ICO fund. You need to feel the panic set in as you realise that this is isn't a nightmare you can wake up from. You need to clutch at the slippery straws of hope as you watch the community desperately rally around a last minute white hat recovery attempt. You need to trudge through the stages of grief until at last you settle into a begrudging  acceptance that your ether has gone. Only then can you feel the cleansing release of letting go of it all and moving on.
 
 - Different levels of participation may become available for those holding higher quantities of **HacKoin**. 

**How can I trust you?**

- You can't. The ICO will be hacked and you will lose all Ethereum you paid in. Period. Why do you need to trust us beyond that?

**Can I read the source code?**

- Yup. [Fork us on Github](https://github.com/hackethereum/hackethereum).

**How can I contact you?**

- Twitter: [@hackethereum](https://twitter.com/hackethereum)

**Do you have a website?**

- Yes: [hackethereum.com](http://hackethereum.com)

### Disclaimers ###
- As with any ICO there are risk involved and we encourage you to send only what you can comfortably afford to lose. **We would like to emphasise that as in this case your losses are expected to be total**, even in the event that everything works as expected. If in the unlikely event that any of the funds are recovered and returned to you our resolution team will reach out with an offer to repatriate your returned funds and ensure your final loses are not disrupted.

- The form the hack will take has not yet been confirmed. We reserve the right for the hack to take the form of an inside job in certain scenarios. We are not obligated to disclose the details of the hack before or after the event has taken place. Any details we do disclose are not required to be factual.

- Many things you read here will probably not be true.

- **You will lose all your money.**
